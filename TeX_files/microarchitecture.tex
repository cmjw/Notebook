\section{Fixed-Program Computer}

A \textbf{fixed-program computer} is a computer that is designed for a particular task. Reprogramming a fixed-program computer may not be possible, or might require restructuring or re-wiring the machine.

\section{Von Neumann Architecture}

\subsection{History}

The original description of a von Neumann architecture defines a computer as having the following components:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Processing unit (ALU + processor registers)
	\item Control unit (PC + instruction registers)
	\item Memory
	\item External mass storage
	\item Input and output mechanisms
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Definition}

A von Neumann architecture generally describes a stored-program computer with a shared memory for data and instructions.

\subsection{Von Neumann Bottleneck}

The \textbf{von Neumann bottleneck} is the reduction in throughput caused by the single bus, which can only access data or instruction data at once.

\subsection{Self-Modifying Code}

In the von Neumann architecture, there is no distinction between data and instruction data. 

\section{Harvard Architecture}

The Harvard architecture is a variant of the von Neumann architecture that attempts to address its limitations. It has separate memories for data and instructions, and separate connections between each and the central control.
